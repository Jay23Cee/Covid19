Currently Using Flask.
Using Python to retrieve Data from API and sending it to Json.
Have a link to a  second  Html file. Currently calling it Graph.
Have a table (homepage) and a plotly bar char (graph) currently working.. 


There's old files from a previous Flask project that needs to be removed and clean. 

Problems:
1) Unable to have a seperate Javascript file because it doesn't recognize the jinja2 template. (SOLUTION: Writing inside the HTML file with a script. One of the disadvantages of using this is the data being receive can be view in 'source code'. )

2)  Needs better Styling. Probably will use a bootstrap/Dash. 

3) Need to update venv
