I CONVERTED THIS TO A COVID-19 API using FLASK

I currently got the graph.html working.
i am able to have a graph be uploaded on the the html using python flask.
Just got an API working regarding US data sets.  ( not exactly what I intended.)4

need to get data from COUNTRY and do a graph comparison with them.

We can include a domestic data / graph set after I finish with this world data first.

Needs a Domestic.HTML if that's what we are planning to do.For now the graph data has a working API for that.

Needs to use better CSS on both Home page. Graph Page and Domestic.
